# Silly-Website
Website created for Mr. Banton's web design class in 2016-2017

I was supposed to add some flash animations to this particular website, as well
as try to keep it a little bit more simple, but I thought, I hate it when I get flash
errors on my computer, so lets get rid of them completely. I used javascript, HTML5, CSS3
and perhaps a little bit of jquery, to build this thing. Explore, try finding all of 
the screw ups I made. I know its a lot, I made this rather fast, so there is bound to 
be so errors. But one of the good things about HTML is that you are allowed to screw up.
Anyways, look around this website, find my mistakes, and perhaps provide suggestions on
how I could change it in the future. Enjoy!
